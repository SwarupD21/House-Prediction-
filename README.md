# 🏠 House Price Prediction - ML Project

This is my first Machine Learning project! The goal is to **predict house prices** . I built this using Python and trained a regression model to make accurate predictions.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Objective**: Predict house prices using historical data.
- **Model Used**: Linear Regression (for now).
- **Tools & Libraries**:
  - Python 
  - Pandas & NumPy
  - Scikit-learn
  - XGB Regressor
  - Google Colab for development

## 🧠 ML Process

1. **Data Cleaning**  
   Handled missing values, removed duplicates.

2. **Feature Engineering**  
   Selected useful features for training.

3. **Model Training**  
   Trained a Linear Regression model using Scikit-learn.

4. **Evaluation**  
   Used metrics like RMSE and R² Score to check performance.
